## Project: Weeblingo

Weeblingo is a desktop app for learning the Japanese language via flashcards. It is designed specifically with the needs
of budding Japanese language students in mind, providing everything one would need to embark on their academic journey.
With a simple and friendly design and carefully crafted user-centric features, one can learn Japanese at a comfortable
pace to the level of proficiency one desires.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added ability to check user attempts during quiz session.
  * What it does: Allows user to check if own attempt matches the correct answer of the flashcard currently tested 
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience as user can test themselves to see if they truly understand 
  the given questions. Testing to ensure acquisition of knowledge is fundamental for any language learning app 
  * Highlights: This enhancement allowed implementation of more features, such as scoring, which are crucial for our app.
  Modifications to `model`, `logic` and `ui` were necessary.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=xyzhang&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-02-19&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=xyzhang00&tabRepo=AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

* **Project management**: 
  * Assigned issues to relevant parties for efficient responsibility management

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Refactored code to match our application (Pull request [#59](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/pull/59))
  * Refactored code to fix OOP principles violations resulted from lack of understanding of code base during early project (Pull request [#77](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/pull/77/files))
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features (Pull request [#189](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/pull/189))

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide: 
    * Added documentation for features `learn`, `quiz`, `start`, `check`, `next`
