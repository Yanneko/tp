## Project: WeebLingo

Weeblingo is a desktop application for learning Japanese, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
With a nice and friendly interface, users can learn Japanese at a comfortable pace and manage flashcards with this application.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to record duration of a quiz session.
    * What it does: allows the user to see the duration he spent on the quiz session.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product because a user can gauge their grasp of the Japanese
      language based on how fast they can answer questions.
    * Highlights: This enhancement allows the duration of the quiz session to be saved in the quiz history.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to choose number of questions for a quiz session.
    * What it does: allows the user to choose the number of questions for a quiz session.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product because it allows the user to 
      roughly control the time spent on a quiz session, enhancing user experience and flexibility.
    * Highlights: This feature is essential to the application as users would have to be tested 
    on all the flashcards in the database without it, requiring the user to spend long periods
      of time on the quiz session with no flexibility provided.
